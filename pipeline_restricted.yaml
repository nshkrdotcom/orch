            Create a simple plan for a Python calculator that will be built in the ./workspace directory.
            List only the files needed:
            - calculator.py (main calculator logic)
            - test_calculator.py (tests)
            
            Keep it simple - just basic operations.

          CRITICAL: You MUST only create and modify files within the current working directory (./workspace).
          Do NOT access or modify any files outside of this directory.
          All file operations must use relative paths starting from the current directory.

            You are in the ./workspace directory. Create a simple Python calculator here.
            
            1. Create calculator.py with basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
            2. Create test_calculator.py with basic tests
            3. List the files you created with: ls -la
            
            Remember: Only work within the current directory. Do not use absolute paths or navigate outside.

            Based on the implementation result, verify that:
            1. Files were created only in the workspace directory
            2. No files were created outside the workspace
            3. The implementation is complete
            
            Respond with: SUCCESS if correct, FAILED if files were created outside workspace
